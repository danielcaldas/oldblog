Hey there! I'm Daniel. I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="https://blip.pt/" target="_blank" title="blip second house">Blip</a> in the beautiful city of Porto in Portugal. My daily job it's to build things for the Internet with the cool cocktail mix of web technologies that we all love. Outside I try to build my own things, lately I been focusing on Open Source, I created <a href="https://github.com/danielcaldas/react-d3-graph" target="_blank" title="rd3g interactive and configurable graphs with react and d3 effortlessly
">react-d3-graph</a> a cool component to build interactive graph data visualizations. I also love music, I try and grab the guitar now and then, it has always been the best way to relax and being able to not think of anything.
