Prepare to set up some rocket science debugging toolkit in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" title="visual studio code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop">VS Code</a> for Javascript. After this you will be kicking ass and showing off your on the fly debugging skills to your peers.

To be precise and not only provide generic instructions on how to setup debugging in VS Code I will provide a step by step guide based on a real open source project so that you can checkout the config and how all the pieces come together. Without further ado I present to you
<a href="https://github.com/danielcaldas/el-conversor" target="_blank" title="a number to word list converter as a node backend and react/redux fronted">el-conversor</a>. The project uses ES6 and the build tool is webpack, this is important to mention because I'm assuming that for you to replicate this setup.

- A local development server for your app.
- Source maps to enable a more stable debugging experience (especially if you're using <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" target="_blank" title="standard ecma-262">ES6</a>).
