If you there as I was, you were probably wandering whether you were at the right conference, since I was thinking the same thing myself (IMPROVE THIS).
But don't give up already! It started poorly on the CSS field, but still it evolved throughout the day with some top notch talks, some of them include [Chen Hui Jing on *The Web Is Not Just Left-to-Right*], [Razvan Caliman on *We have DevTools. What about DesignTools?*]

## The city

## The talks
As I mentioned earlier the 1st talk wasn't so much into CSS, what Trent gave to us was more of a carrier advice on how we should behave
as individuals so that we are seen as part (...), for Trent going solo in some project should never be even considered, we should always ask for feedback in order to achieve accurate and quality results. Trent mentioned an app (APP HERE) and techniques to achieve mindfulness, and how it can we improve
our quality at the workspace.

Next we had Jackie Balzer who basically told was the history behind Behance’s (link to site) codebase, how major rediseigns left
jurassic footprints in the codebase that are today pretty much non "deletable" since well, no one knows why it's actually that way or how come nobody deleted that piece of code, TODO comments spread throughout the project, in the end the description at css conf official web site says it all ("how to be at peace with the reality of a fragmented codebase.").

The next talk was just mind opening. Chen Hui Jing made a very cool historical overview on typography, how some asian cultures write vertically, and how
that was transported into the web. Designing various labeled pencils in different formats along the way Chen explained how we could take advantage of flex-box
to approach vertical text, and also how can occidental cultures use these approaches to make use of vertical text in specific situations that would bring a much nicer look and fell to our website.

Ollie Williams - don't remember this guy mention of css grid. Graceful degradation and how can we provide cutting edge experiences users on modern browsers while still being available to those old versions of the browser...

Razvan Caliman DevTools - This was the morning session closing talk, and man what a finish! The point of this talk was all about how advanced tooling we have nowadays in browsers for developers to debug and analyze applications, but what about designers? And also, what about tools to support the design part of the web
development process? Well Raz made a pretty good point by exposing the problem this way, in fact he presented a few pains of the design part of the web from a developer prespective this include editing styles on the fly using the element inspector, managing css shapes (IS THIS A THING? css shapes), ...

Here you have the list of tools that Razvan mentioned in his talk:
- Flinch..
- shape editor...

The talk ended with a kind of "*cry for help*" request, Razvan mentioned that not so many developers were focused on building design dev tools to improve development experience, he encouraged the community to make more dev tools to improve our work flow making other developers life easier.

Shwetank Dixit - Simulating Low-Vision Conditions with CSS, SVG and WebRTC

When we here “Low-vision” what do we think about? Well Shwetank explained that these days low-vision it's just a umbrella term that aggregates a bunch of eyesight conditions that affect people in many different ways. Shwetank made very clear that not conditioned people don't know the real extent of these problems unless we
talk with someone who experienced them. Following, Shwetank just drop this one "What if we could make tools to make people see what people with low-vision actually see?" And that was exactly what he did, with CSS, SVG and WebRTC  he was able to emulate different low-vision conditions that were perceptible trough a camera,
this is a really noble thing to do, it certainly will make non conditional people more aware and comprehensive of this problems, at the same time I guess it makes
conditioned people less frustrated because I imagine it can be pretty hard to explain ones condition to another, so why not showing it instead?

Mike Riethmuller - Strategy Guide for CSS Custom Properties !!!!! Awesome!

Here we will finally look into some CSS!
- Talk description
- Interactive sample (include some codepen iframe or something)
- Can I use this? (meme of internet explorer blocking the way)
looking into the numbers, well yeah, it is supported in the major browsers with exception for IE but well who knows what the well are those people
doing in the internet anyways.

Dag-Inge Aas - Accessible by Law! Generating Colors with JS and CSS Custom Properties

Is you website compliant with the accessability standards? Well you better check that out since for instance in Norway, all websites are required by law to be accessible. Company X did work on this... There are benchmarks for accessibility here... There is an algorithm for this...

Lara Schenck - The Algorithms of CSS (this is just wrong, this speaker mixed CSS usage and purpose with the CSS implementation)

Philip Walton - Container Queries: The Past, Future, and How You Can Actually Even Use Them Today

Claudina Sarahe - Design Systems as Facilitators
In this talk I just remember hearing the term "Facilitator" a lot... Really, a lot! I didn't remember this talk at all (you know how it is, 8 hours straight of hearing talks, you just wanna go and grab that fresh bear)...




## tl;dr
Seems like the new hottest css things are css variables. If you are not used to the accessebility variable whne building websites you should... Norway...
Grid VS Flex VS other alternatives... Progressive enhancement VS Graceful degradation (does your website really needs to work properly (MELHORAR ISTO.. MAS A IDEIA É ESTA) everywhere?)...

## Hot topics
- CSS custom properties (variable)
- Accessability (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- Media queries
- Feature queries (@supports)
