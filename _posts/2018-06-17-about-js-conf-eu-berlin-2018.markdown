## For starters
As promised in the post on [CSSconf EU 2018](https://goodguydaniel.com/jekyll/update/2018/06/17/about-css-conf-eu-berlin-2018.html) I will now talk a bit about the JSConf EU 2018 that preceded the CSSConf in the Berlin Arena (June 2nd and 3rd).

## Berlin
You know Berlin right? The capital and largest city in Germany, also one of the largest and multicultural cities in europe. Despite the conference busy schedule I took sometime (mainly my last day) to visit a few of the high rated places in Berlin such as the museum island, the Berlin Cathedral, the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie and a few other spots. It is really worth visiting, besides the obvious places that you would wanna check as the ones mentioned previously Berlin has a great urban structure with organized and large street blocks composed by beautiful buildings, huge and various green spaces and of course an endless nightlife cater for all tastes.

## The venue
So, the event toke place at the Berlin Arena, an old building/factory kind of *hipster* place, very cool and very hot by that time of the year! Good thing water was free of charge and could be reached by a few steps from almost any place inside the arena. So yeah despite the cool space and stage set up, there where always free soft drinks (and frozen yogurt!) around to make sure one's never dehydrate. Talking about stage, aside the unbearable heat, the space was pretty cozy with round tables so that people could have laptops and other stuff on the table while assisting to the talks.

Throughout the venue there were exhibition stands of the sponsor companies, aside the *goodies* you could see products demonstration, talk to people about the company or even get a job interview.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner where included in the ticket, so me and my colleagues agreed that it would be worth and try and so we venture into the vegan world (for me practically unknown at the time). The food was nice I mean, I had the opportunity to try a few dishes such as vegan hamburger, vegan gnocchi, vegan pasta, you get it...

(*Above, clear proof of laziness, using tables to display images side by side so that I don't need to leave the markdown file. Shame on me.*)

At the end of the talks, we just grabbed a bear near the river and enjoy the remaining sunshine (no, we could not use the pool).

## The talks (Highlights)
As you're probably expecting the talks weren't exclusively technical (of course we got to see a few *hands on* kind of presentation) topics ranged from ethics, productivity, history all the way to the more technical realm with performance, user experience, machine learning, IoT and of course the Javascript language itself (<a href="https://2018.jsconf.eu/schedule/" target="_blank" title="jsconf eu 2018 berlin schedule">check out the conference full schedule</a>). Also worth mentioning, there were some electronic music live performances by <a href="https://twitter.com/nested_loops?lang=en" target="_blank" title="nested_loops twitter">nested_loops</a> and <a href="http://livejs.network/" target="_blank" title="live:js official website">live:js</a>, the sound and the visual effects played nicely producing a nice show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPWRaN2PXZw" target="_blank" title="live:js opening performance youtube">check out the conference opening</a>.
